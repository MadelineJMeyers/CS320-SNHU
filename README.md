This is a portfolio item created during my time working towards a Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science with Southern New Hampshire University.

1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

   Testing is an important tool to prove that any project is functional but it is important to create tests that show both that a program should work as expected and should fail as expected.
   I use both of these types of tests to prove conclusively that my code is functional and that any exceptions that are defined are thrown as expected.
   When it comes to security, I will be careful with how I create my code to prevent potential vulnerabilities and work to learn effective testing techniques to idenitify potential vulnerabilities before they are released.

  
2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

    I will consider what type of program the customer is asking for me to build and from there I will work with the user to see how I can best work within their needs and expectations for the program.
    I will also create a requirements document to reference to ensure that the highest priority needs are implemented. If there are any ambiguities in the user's needs I will work with them to ensure that their expectations are communicated clearly so we are in an understanding of how the program needs to be structured.


3. How do I approach designing software?

   When I am designing a piece of software first I think about what it needs to be capable of. For instance, if I am designing a program to manage information I consider my options about how the data would need to be managed. I also consider how complicated the program needs to be and I work to design as simple version of the program as I can while remaining in the requirements established. I also consider what the needs of the stakeholders will be and the standards expected for the organization I am working with during my designing phase. After designing the first version of a program, I then try to refine the program and polish it until I am as satisfied as I can be while keeping with any deadlines set.
